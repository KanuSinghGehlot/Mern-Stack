         <p style="font-size: 9px;">Hip-hop dancing refers to a range of <font color = "red">street dances</font> that developed in relation to hip hop music and culture. 
         Main styles of hip-hop dancing include Breaking, Locking and Popping, with derivative styles emerging out of these including Memphis
